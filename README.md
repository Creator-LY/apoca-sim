# Apoca-Sim
Apocalyptic Simulation allows you to observe and interact with various species represented as moving shapes on your screen. Dive into a virtual ecosystem where each species interacts with one another, causing changes in their statistics and providing a visual representation of the population dynamics over time.

### Features includes

+ Species Interactions: Witness the dynamic interactions between different species as they move around the screen. Observe how their behaviors, such as predation, competition, and symbiosis, affect their populations and overall ecosystem equilibrium.

+ Day/night, rain and lighting system: Addition effect that impacts the ecosystem. Specie changes behaviour on day/night, plant growth rate change on rain and lighting causes unfortunate death in species. 

+ Statistical Changes: Every interaction within the ecosystem causes changes in the species' statistics. These statistics may include population size, birth rates, death rates, energy levels, and other relevant factors.

+ Population Visualization: Offers a visually appealing representation of the changing population dynamics over time. Watch as the shape representing the species grow or shrink, displaying the relative population sizes and the effects of different interactions. Observe patterns, trends, and potential feedback loops as the ecosystem evolves.

+ Editing Tool: Dynamically add or remove species during the simulation. With a simple interface, you can select from a range of species available and introduce them into the ecosystem. As you add new species, the existing ones will react and adapt to the presence of the newcomers, leading to changes in their behaviors and population dynamics. Likewise, removing species from the ecosystem will have an impact on the remaining species, potentially altering their interactions and population sizes.
